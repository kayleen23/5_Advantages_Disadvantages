List 5 advantages and disadvantages of V-methodologies
Advantages
1.Simple and easy to use.
2.Saves alot of time.
3. Defects are found at an early stage.
4.Avoids the downward flow of the defects.
5.Works well for small projects.

Disadvantages
1.Very rigid
2.Least Flexible
3.No early prototypes of the software is produced .
4.If any changes happen in midway, then the test documents along with requirement documents has to be updated.
5.Doesnt provide a clear path for problems found during testing phases.

List 5 advantages and disadvantages of the protoype methodologies
Advantages
1.Reduced times and cost.
2.Improved and increased user involement.
3.Test usabilty to find problems.
4.East to communicate with users.
5.Improve the efficiency of product design

Disadvantages
1.Time consuming.
2.Prototype design may constrain the designers ideas.
3.Formal end of phase reviews might occur.
4.System documentation is often absent or incomplete because primary focus is on development of the prototype.
5.Security issues can be overlooked in the haste to develop a prototype.
